# Sorting-Algo

This project implements several popular sorting algorithms and visualizes them using the Pygame module in Python.

How to Run
Install Python 3.x from here
Install Pygame by running pip install pygame in your terminal.
Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run python main.py to launch the sorting visualizer.
Supported Algorithms
The following sorting algorithms are currently implemented in this project:

Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort

Once you run main.py, a Pygame window will open displaying a randomly generated array of bars. You can select the desired algorithm from the dropdown menu and click the Sort button to start the sorting process. The bars will animate in real-time, showing the progress of the sorting algorithm.
You can also stop the sorting process wherever and whichever state you want.
